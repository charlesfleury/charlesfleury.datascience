Here is a description of the data analysis and data science projects I coded that are in this repository.
They are based on guided projects from the dataquest.io Data Scientist Path.

1. [Mobile App Profiling]()

This project uses data collected on the App Store and Google Play app markets to analyze the profitable type of apps on those digital marketplaces.
In this project, I use data on genre, popularity and number of ratings of apps to build a recommendation for a fictionnal start-up that would like to develop an app on both markets.
