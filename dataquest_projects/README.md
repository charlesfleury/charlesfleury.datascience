Here is a description of the data analysis and data science projects I coded that are in this repository.
They are based on guided projects from the dataquest.io Data Scientist Path.

1. [Mobile Apps Profiling](https://github.com/charlesfleury/charlesfleury.datascience/blob/master/dataquest_projects/Mobile_Apps_Profiling/mobile_apps_profiling_cf.ipynb)

This project features data collected on the App Store and Google Play app markets to analyze the profitable type of apps on those digital marketplaces using basic Python.
In this project, I use data on genre, popularity and number of ratings of apps to build a recommendation for a fictionnal start-up that would like to develop an app on both markets.

2. [Ebay Car Sales Exploring](https://github.com/charlesfleury/charlesfleury.datascience/blob/master/dataquest_projects/EBay_Car_Sales_Exploring/eBay_Car_Sales_Project_cf.ipynb)

This project features data from the german car-selling section of eBay. I use this data to extract some interesting metrics about the available cars using Numpy and Pandas.

3. [Predicting Car Prices with K-Nearest-Neighbors]()

In this project, I use data collected on multiple cars and apply a machine learning algorithm, the K-Nearest-Neighbors, to try and predict car prices and at the same time discover which features were the most influent on car prices at the time of data collection. I am using the Sklearn library as well as the more common data science Python libraries.
